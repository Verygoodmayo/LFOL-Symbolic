          <p>
            The Forum of London deeply regrets the sad loss of our very dear friend and mentor, Dr Nestor Tamarin. Nestorâ€™s unflagging commitment to the cause of psychoanalysis and the sheer generosity of his spirit in sharing this have touched and inspired many of us.
          </p>
          <p>
            This was his founding act in the creation of our forum and it shall remain his legacy to us, both as a collective and as individuals, who have gained so much from his energy, his enthusiasm and his sincere friendship. We remember Nestor with respect and love.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our thoughts and sympathies are with Daphne, Mia and the rest of his family.
